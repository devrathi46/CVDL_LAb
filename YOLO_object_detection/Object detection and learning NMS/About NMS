üìå Why is NMS Necessary?
Multiple Detections for the Same Object: YOLO predicts multiple bounding boxes for a single object, each with a confidence score.

Overlapping Bounding Boxes: Without NMS, we get many overlapping boxes for the same object, leading to redundant detections.

Improved Detection Accuracy: NMS selects the best bounding box based on confidence scores and discards less confident ones.

Better Visualization: NMS makes object detection results clearer by avoiding cluttered overlapping boxes.

üîç How NMS Works?
Sort the detections by confidence scores (highest first).

Select the highest-confidence bounding box and remove all other boxes that have high IoU (Intersection over Union) with it.

Repeat the process until no more boxes need to be removed.
